# FiberCrypto C library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/fibercrypto/libfibercrypto.svg)](https://travis-ci.com/fibercrypto/libfibercrypto)

FiberCrypto C library (a.k.a `libfibercrypto`) exports the FiberCrypto API to DApps using the C programming language.
It is also the foundation to build client libraries for other programming languages.

## Links

* [Fiber](https://www.skycoin.com/fiber/)

## Subprojects

The FiberCrypto C library is made of the following components

- `lib/cgo`     : C wrappers for the Fibercrypto core API
- `lib/swig`    : SWIG interfaces to generate wrappers around the Fibercrypto core API for other programming languages

Consult respective `README` files for further details.

## Development setup

### Running tests

```sh
$ make test-libc
```

### Releases

#### Update the version

0. If the `master` branch has commits that are not in `develop` (e.g. due to a hotfix applied to `master`), merge `master` into `develop` (and fix any build or test failures)
0. Switch to a new release branch named `release-X.Y.Z` for preparing the release.
0. If the release process needs modifications, edit these steps before moving forward
0. Ensure that the submodule at `vendor/github.com/fibercrypto/FiberCryptoWallet` is in sync with respect to the corresponding tag in https://github.com/fibercrypto/FiberCryptoWallet repository.
0. Update `CHANGELOG.md`: move the "unreleased" changes to the version and add the date.
0. Run `make docs` to regenerate documentation for all libraries and ensure they ar up-to-date.
0. Follow the steps in [pre-release testing](#pre-release-testing)
0. Make a PR merging the release branch into `master`
0. Review the PR and merge it
0. Tag the `master` branch with the version number. Version tags start with `v`, e.g. `v0.20.0`. Sign the tag. If you have your GPG key in github, creating a release on the Github website will automatically tag the release. It can be tagged from the command line with `git tag -as v0.20.0 $COMMIT_ID`, but Github will not recognize it as a "release".
0. Release builds are created and uploaded by travis. To do it manually, checkout the master branch and make release.
0. Merge changes in `master` back into `develop` branch to start working towards next stable version.

#### Pre-release testing

Perform these actions before releasing:

```sh
make check
```
#### Release signing

Releases are signed with this PGP key:

`0x5801631BD27C7874`

The fingerprint for this key is:

```

Follow the [Tor Project's instructions for verifying signatures](https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en).

If you can't or don't want to import the keys from a keyserver, the signing key is available in the repo: [gz-c.asc](gz-c.asc).

Releases and their signatures can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/fibercrypto/FiberCryptoWallet/releases).

## Development

We have two branches: `master` and `develop`.

- `develop` is the default branch and will always have the latest code.
  The submodule at `gopath/src/github.com/fibercrypto/FiberCryptoWallet` has to be
  in sync with `fibercrypto/FiberCryptoWallet` `develop` branch.
- `master` will always be equal to the current stable release on the website, and should correspond with the latest release tag.
  The submodule at `gopath/src/github.com/fibercrypto/FiberCryptoWallet` has to be
  in sync with `fibercrypto/FiberCryptoWallet` `master` branch.

Separate stable development branches will be created to work on releases for supporting the
most recent stable version of Skycoin. The name of these branches should be the Skycoin
major and minor version numbers followed by `dev` suffix e.g. `0.25dev`.
These branches may be forked out of either `master` or `develop` branches, and 
the submodule at `gopath/src/github.com/fibercrypto/FiberCryptoWallet` has to be
in sync with the corresponding tag of `fibercrypto/FiberCryptoWallet` official repository.

Stable development branches are created most of the time for the following reasons:

- A Skycoin release increasing [patch version number](https://semver.org/).
- Enhanced support and bug fixes for a version of the library compiled against an
  stable version of Skycoin
- Backporting useful features added in `develop`.

### General development guidelines

The following rules are enforced

- Contributions must comply to the development guidelines documented in the [Skycoin wiki](https://github.com/fibercrypto/FiberCryptoWallet/wiki).
- C / C++ code must comply to the [Bitcoin C coding style](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md#coding-style-c) (enforced by `clang-format`).

### SkyApi libcurl client for Skycoin REST API

This wrapper is auto-generated by `openapi-generator` directly from [Skycoin REST API code](https://github.com/fibercrypto/FiberCryptoWallet/tree/master/src/api).

For further instructions see [Autogenerated documentation](./lib/curl/README.md).

### Doxygen comment syntax

If you want to continue with `the doxygen way`(we recommend it) of coding and document functions, structs, and functions, you should follow the specifications found in the [Doxygen official site](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html).

Inside `/* */`  we found struct documentation, meanwhile `//<` symbol is used to describe fields of the struct.

After that, run `make docs` for a new docs generation. You can found the api documentation at `docs/libc` folder.
